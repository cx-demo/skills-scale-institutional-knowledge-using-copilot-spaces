# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs!

This repository centralizes OctoAcme's project management process documentation, templates, and standards to promote transparency, consistency, and repeatability across all cross-functional projects.

## Project Management Processes Summary

### Key Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every project.
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments with frequent feedback.
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning across the team.

### Lifecycle Stages

OctoAcme projects follow a standardized lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish a high-level timeline.
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, and align timelines and responsibilities.
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular standups, demos, and quality checks.
4. **Release**: Deploy to production with proper verification, rollback plans, and stakeholder communication.
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

### Core Practices

- **Project One-pager**: A concise document capturing the problem, goal, success metrics, stakeholders, and timeline.
- **Risk Register**: Track risks with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plans.
- **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Clear acceptance criteria for all backlog items.
- **Regular Communication**: Weekly syncs, standups, and stakeholder updates ensure alignment.
- **Retrospectives**: After each sprint or release, capture what went well, what could improve, and action items.
